# stm32g070rbt6-cube-gcc-makefile

This is a project template generated by STM32CubeMX for STM32G070RBT6 for my own Fanke G070 Pink Board.

The User codes is to demo:

- how to drive a 0.96inch ST7735 SPI LCD
- how to implement `__io_getchar` and `__io_putchar` for UART printf required by syscalls.c used with arm gcc toolchain. (in `usart.c`).
- how to handle UTF8 characters. (in `lcd_spi_096.c`)
- how to enable float support for printf (`-u _printf_float` in LDFLAGS)
